Spain began as they usually do: controlling the ball, pressing high, searching for an early strike. Possession, patience, precision—football known around the world. They moved it with elegance, probing for space and waiting for the perfect moment.

And that moment arrived. Asensio received outside the box, lifted his head and spotted the gap. A powerful, precise strike—an arrow into the top corner. Goal! Spain leads. The stadium celebrates, but Canada does not quit. They never do.

Canada increased the intensity and found belief. The pace of their attacks began to trouble Spain’s back line. Counterattacks became more frequent and more dangerous.

Then came Jonathan David, Canada’s star striker. A ball in behind, a race into the box; Spain tries to close but it’s too late. David pounces on a defensive mistake, faces the keeper and finishes with cold precision. Goal! It’s level. The crowd erupts—Canadians celebrate like it’s a final. What character!

Spain responded with quality. A beautifully constructed attack—switches of play, Canadian lines stretched. Pedri sees the window and delivers a surgical cross. Morata rises—perfect leap, perfect header. Goal! Spain retakes the lead before the break.

After halftime, Canada returned transformed. Alphonso Davies—pace and technique down the left—left defenders speechless. Every touch felt like danger.

Davies collected on the flank, lifted his head and spotted movement. He accelerated—one defender, then another left behind. The crowd stood and roared. A left‑footed cross, perfect for Jonathan David. David rose; time slowed; the header was flawless… Goal! Level again! The stadium exploded in joy. What a goal! Davies and David—perfect combination.

But the best was yet to come. Davies anticipated a pass in midfield, won the ball and took off. He sprinted fifty meters with the ball glued to his foot, burned past defenders, faced the keeper… The moment was perfect, the angle perfect… Strike! What a thunderbolt! Alphonso Davies! Canada leads. Incredible. The stadium went wild; Canadian fans jumped, hugged and cried with joy. What a player. What a moment.

Spain, desperate, threw everyone forward. La Roja pressed with everything searching for the equalizer. Oyarzabal turned and struck toward the Canadian goal… Davies again! A last‑second block on the goal line—heroic. Canadian fans erupted in applause. Heart, commitment, leadership—Davies not only attacked, he defended with his life.

The final minutes were tense and breathless. Every Spanish cross was danger; every Canadian clearance was cheered like a goal. One last corner; the ball sailed into the area, heads rose, but the Canadian keeper stretched and pushed it away. Relief across the stadium.

The referee checked his watch; supporters counted the seconds. Time froze. Silence.
