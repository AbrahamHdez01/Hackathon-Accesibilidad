From sunrise, Mexico City has been buzzing. Thousands of fans from both nations arrived early to live this historic moment. Streets are filled with colors, flags and chants announcing what’s to come.

For the United States, confidence is high after recent tournament wins. Captain Christian Pulisic is the player to watch—his speed and technique have been vital. Every touch hints at something special. Giovanni Reyna’s vision and pinpoint passing make him another star everyone expects to shine. Weston McKennie’s ball‑winning and box‑to‑box engine, Matt Turner’s reliability in goal and the emergence of Folarin Balogun up front round out a hungry, fearless team.

Argentina, the world champion, brings experience and magic. Lionel Messi—captain, icon, genius—seeks to keep making history. One touch, one feint, and he can change everything. Alongside him, Julián Álvarez’s lethal movement in the box, Enzo Fernández’s balance in midfield and the core of the squad that conquered Qatar know exactly what it takes to win at the highest stage.
